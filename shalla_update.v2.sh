# shalla_update.sh, v 0.3.1 20080403
# done by kapivie at sil.at under FreeBSD
# without any warranty
# updated by Len Tucker to create and use diff
# files to reduce load and increase speed.
# Added Checks for required elements
# Added output info for status of script
# Modified by Chris Kronberg: included loop; added some more
# checks; reduced the diff files to the necessary content.
